Agorregi jatetxea
"This is a very good restaurant in a city where good cuisine is an add-on value of culture and well-being. It is not located down-town but you can get it after 15 minutes of car driving from the city center. Menu a la carte or menu degustation are really precious examples of excellent gastronomy. Fish or meat, or even a fantastic pigeon dish will demonstrate the level of the chef ability. Something to improve is list of deserts. Good wine selection. To be remembered."
"We had the men? degustaci?n. They have such good food and service, totally value for money. We would repeat for sure and we definitely recommend. One of the top restaurants of the city."
Outstanding food quality with very good service. Highly recommendable. Ideal for business meals or with family or friends.
This is a small restaurant tucked away in the industrial outskirts of Donostia. With 4-5 tables only you will not escape the attention of the servicing staff. We took the menu which was very well done. We took the menu that gave us fish and beef which was extremely well done. Here the chef really had put effort in the menu. The wine list is exhaustive and offers many local choices. Dinner comes with personal attention and clearly with love for food.
Enjoyed a wonderful meal with my wife at this restaurant which was very close to our accommodation.The 2 ladies serving were very friendly and both spoke good English.The food was superb and we had the tasting menu which included wines . Great value at 44 Euros per person.Would highly recommend!
"Excellent planning, reception, and birthday meal at this gem of a restaurant in San Sebastian. Yes, you're going to have to take a cab or drive to get to this amazing restaurant 10 minutes away from downtown, but if you're going to take one night to have a serious meal away from the pintxos of the city center, this is the one! Beatriz is very friendly and welcoming and easily planned vegetarian options for my mother and other menu tweaks for my friends. The service if friendly but discrete, which gave us a lot of room for socializing among ourselves throughout the dinner. The value for money is very good, from Gorka's creations to the wine pairings. I'll definitely be popping back next time I'm in San Sebastian!"
"When you come as a couple (we don't know how it works In a bigger group) the concept of the restaurant allows you two only to order the same dishes, whether you choose a set menu or whatever dishes you'd like from the regular menu, it did not allow us to try all the dishes we wanted to but it did make the experience special we were served each dish at the same time at a medium to small sized portion, (we didn't pick the set menu), we had a shared experience of tasting the same things at the same time the food was amazing we enjoyed greatly each dish we had, definitely recommend this restaurant."
We had such an amazing luck at Agorregu Jatetxea. The service was perfect and the food was top notch. The price for the quality of food and service you get is very worth it. Definitely recommend the restaurant if you're in San Sebasti?n and want to try some great Basque food.

"Location is somewhat unusual but don’t let that put you off.Some slight confusion at the beginning of our visit as my partner is gluten free but happily resolved and we both had a revised tasting menu.The 5 course menu had some real gems particularly the tuna tartare and hake on mashed potato.The wines were generally good, the red particularly so.Staff and service were lovely,relaxed and very friendly.If you are in town I would recommend a vist"

"We found it on our own though it was far from our hotel. It's simple, tasty and inexpensive. It wasn't a so simple to get a vegetarian meal but once clear my food was great. acvomendateAcommendation"
We visited this restaurant for my friends hen weekend. There were 10 vegetarians and 5 meat eaters. The restaurant went out of their way to provide a fantastic and varied menu for us vegetarians and to the same quality and standard to the meat eaters menu. Beatrice and her husband are great hosts and i fully recommend this place for a lovely meal which is Michelin standard without the price tag! Thank you!
A group of my girlfriends & I enjoyed a wonderful meal here last week during our week in San Sebasti?n. The service was professional and friendly and the food was fantastic. Would highly recommend a visit to this charming family run restaurant!
"We saw good reviews online and thought this would be a good place for lunch. We were a family of my wife and I, my daughter, my eldest daughter and her husband and baby of six months old. We told the restaurant ahead that we had a baby and it was too small for a high chair and may be sleeping in it's pushchair. They gave us a nice table with plenty of room for us to rock the baby to sleep. We had the tasting menu which included a half bottle of wine each. It was excellent. It represents good value and we would recommend you get along to Agorregi for a great experience. We arrived at 1.30pm and were the only diners there but by 2pm the place was full. The staff were very good. Wish We could go back there again soon."
"Last month I went with my husband and mother to Agorregi and we had a very nice meal. I had advised that I was gluten free and dairy free at the time of my booking and they had made preparations so that I was able to order the gourmet plus menu and enjoy almost everything. Aside from a few revisions, my meal didn't look too different from my husband's plate aside from the removal of some toast, the omission of some sauce, and the substitution of sorbet for ice cream and skipping the tiramisu course. This in itself was a great feat for any restaurant, the fact that they did it well is another. The restaurant even made me a special gf df bread that was soft, warm, crusty and nicely textured. The only hiccup was we were shown a menu for the previous week and chose the gourmet plus menu based on that reason since we were excited by the prospect of a couple of the dishes but disappointed by when the menu was a bit different than our initial expectations. The meal started out strong with a foie gras dish that was smooth, light and well paired with flake salt and cherry confiture. The seasonal pea dish that was next was a pleasant surprise and we really enjoyed the combination of flavours and the simple fresh taste of spring peas. The scrambled egg with black truffle tasted warm and comforting in the best possible way. The stewed codfish was full of flavour and even my anti-fish husband approved. Unfortunately, I wasn't a huge fan of the pigeon that came out instead of the Iberian Pork we thought we were getting - not that the pigeon was ill prepared, but every dish to this point was building my expectations, and this one fell a little flat but my indifference to pigeon is probably just a personal preference. Thankfully the following course I had - the red fruit soup brought it back for a strong finish for me complete with a light refreshing vanilla sorbet (in lieu of ice cream). The meal was definitely excellent value for the price."
"We have visited Agorregi four times over recent years. It sits in an office / business district of San Sebastian about 5 - 10 mins from La Concha but it is always worth a visit. It is not one of the famed Michelin 3* establishments which are so expensive but for those who enjoy good fresh cooking a great alternative at an affordable price. For us it is a perfect alternative to an evening of pintxos bar hopping. Last week we went for supper and had their Gourmet menu @ € 51 per person rather than their other set menu (which is around € 35 inc. wine). We both asked to swap our foie gras starter, which they readily did without any fuss, for a delicate smoked salmon salad with a delicious dressing. Amongst the courses was some beautifully cooked hake and lamb. Always a friendly welcome from Beatrix and her staff. I am sure we will be back on out next visit and are happy to tell others friends visiting San Sebastian about it. Good luck and thanks."
"Having had a family dinner here in 2012, my partner and I brought some friends for Saturday lunch during a short break to San Sebastian. As with our first dining experience, everybody truly enjoyed the whole experience. I e-mailed our booking and pointed out that although we wanted the tasting menu, my partner has a shellfish allergy, and asked for variations for her where applicable. No problem. The balance of flavours were superb, and the wine list adequate and extremely good value. We had an excellent Albarinho for 20 Euros, and a memorable Ribero del Duero for 35 Euros, both of which would be double the price in some other establishments. Yes, it is in a strange location between a kitchen showroom and a car dealership, but so what? It's the food, wine and ambience inside that count, and they are all superb. Will definitely be going back."
