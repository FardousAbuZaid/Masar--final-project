Donostia - San Sebasti?n Hop On - Hop Off Sightseeing Tour
"The Funicular was good fun! As what you see at the top wasn’t expected. Kids would love the little boat trip, rollercoaster, amusements etc fabulous view at the top!!"
"Found the tour had several difficulties. The frequency in which the bus picks up at the different stops was very long. Also, we had a difficult time finding the place where to start the tour. Signage was very poor. Then when I called the phone number on our paper it was in Barcelona and the people had no information on where to meet the bus."
"The coach was clean , timely , effecient and everything one would expect. The information was very informative and clear. It was also very busy. The main thought I had after the trip was that San Sebastian was not really the best city to have a hop on hop off Sightseeing tour - simply because it is so much more intersting and beautiful on the ground to walk around , and it has quite a short itinerary."
"The circuit is not very long, we stopped at Mont Iguel and after the visit we had to wait more than half an hour to take the bus back, the stops are not announced in advance despite the map we has trouble finding our way, we found ourselves at the end of the course with the feeling of unfinished and disappointed for the price 13.50 Euros per person ...."
"Like all similar services in other cities, this one also offers an excellent opportunity to get to know the most popular places in San Sebastian, comfortably seated on the bus."
"It is a pity that the bus is not well prepared with the faulty audio system. How difficult it is to be the driver of this bus in a city with so many works and with so many traffic problems like badly parked cars. However, the driver who took us that day patiently served the entire public with a smile, apologizing that the audio was not working and for being late to the stops due to traffic problems. Good for her, the best service."
"It is a not so old way of seeing the city in a different way and from another point of view in broad strokes, although it is a city to walk, this route helps and is correct with the route in general."
