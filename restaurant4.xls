"The comments you read here and elsewhere on the internet are pretty accurate. The food is of a very high standard for a 1 star restaurant. We ate really well; in addition to the culinary quality, every dish was actually delicious. And the wine pairings were great too.However, there is something oddly austere about the service and atmosphere. Overly serious, a sense of being hurried through the meal, and a lack of generosity of spirit.Would nevertheless recommend for an excellent lunch. But with some tweaks it could be really great."
"A gem of a restaurant! Close to the city center, but still in a ""rural"" surrounding.The staff was very welcoming and polite.We went for the tasting menu with the wine package.Every dish was well presented, and the wines went excellent to the food. The top dish to me was the sirloin!I strongly recommend this wonderful place if you are into fine dining in an extraordinary surrounding."
"Unexpected. We heard this is a new place but the behavior is like a good respect restaurant.The place is an old apple cider place with the barrels as a decoration amazing.The restaurant has it’s own parking very important:).We decided to pick our dishes and share, the restaurant gives you the dishes divided for 2 persons very nice and kind.Every dish is special I’ll mention the cod fish the sardines cream and the gin and tonic dessert.Amazing place you should go"
"This is our second time here. Loved this restaurant. A bit more expensive than the first time I came, but last time it did not have a Michellin star. We had the ravioli to start and I had the Chuleton, my daughter the Steak Tartare and my son the arroz de Almejas. Each one better than the next. Dessert I would go for Torrijas. Delicious."
"My wife and I had high expectations for this one star Michelin restaurant and we were not disappointed. The interior has a clean ""country modern"" elegance. The tables are widely spaced. Interestingly, there is no music in the background, lending to the calm, peaceful atmosphere. We did not opt for the tasting menu. Instead we created our own mini-tasting menus. This is facilitated by the restaurant's wise and generous practice of allowing half portions for many of the appetizers and main courses. This is an idea that should be adopted more universally! Outstanding starting courses included steak tartare (very large portion), oxtail ravioli (delicious, but tiny portion and surprisingly more expensive than the steak) and octopus tartar. The 2 fish dishes (half portions) were superb; both seemed to ""melt"" in our mouths. We finished with 2 desserts (probably should have ordered only one!) - chocolate souffl?'s and a carmelized french toast creation. More wows! Wine was very affordable, with an excellent selection. Service was perfect - attentive, coordinated, friendly, informative. This was a terrific experience."
"The location is a bit of, so we first thought that we missed a road, because it really looks like you are going in to the backstreets of a industrial area we took a bus from the city up to the hills, very easy but the building is very nice up close. We got a friendly greeting and were shown to our table. The interior is very simple and minimalistic, so there is a slight eco in the room. Good to know that you might need to keep your voice down.The menu is very interesting and have a wide range of very nice meals. We selected the Great Tasting menu with wine pairing. The menu included a appetizer and then Premium steak tartar with olives in textures. This had a fabulous taste to it. It continued with Lobster salad, caper gel, tomato confit. We would have preferred to have the lobster before the tartar, because it had a much more delicate taste and the tartar was much more overpowering.After this we got Egg yolk, herbal’s liquid carbonara and bacon carpaccio. Don’t miss this! Fantastic taste of the yolk and herbal liquid. Next is Oxtail Ravioli, foam of parmesan and juice of port and truffle. Unfortunately a little bit dry ravioli, both the ox and the truffle taste almost disappeared. But it was compensated by the next course, Grilled hake with Iberian carpaccio, wakame juice, seaweed salad and almond, The next course was a fabulous “Luismi’s” sirlion, tuber’s Tagliatelle with carbonara and perigueux. Both of these courses was very nice, sirloin was cooked very well, rear to medium like we prefer.After this we got a pre dessert. We liked the pre dessert actually better then the actual dessert, it was with berry’s and that would be a nicer ending to the meal. The Lemon with basil juice, citrus touches and cinnamon was a little bit to crisp and would be better as a pre dessert and palette cleanser...Overall it was a nice experience and would absolutely return for some specific courses that we enjoyed a lot."
We were staying quite close by and had booked a Sunday afternoon lunch here. We had the tasting menu which was fantastic. The atmosphere seemed slightly austere at first but the staff were great and we soon relaxed to enjoy the experience.
"Sampled the lunch menu and was very pleased with the result. All dishes were of a high quality and menu didn't skimp on nice touches (amuse bouche etc). Sevice was good too. Wines by the glass were excellent value, as was the lunch menu more generally."
"We are family of 4 and had a very good dinner. The staff was very attentive and they could make changes to the degustation menu for our two people with food allergies. All the dishes were good, the last dessert was very interesting and we took a while to figure out how to mix the flavours so none would be overpowering. Nevertheless the food was great and we left very satisfied and full."
"Myself and my wife had a lovely meal. The bread was good, fresh though not exceptional. I had the fish soup which was a very good fish soup. My wife had the oxtail ravioli with mushroom sauce which was excellent. I had the cod cheeks which were very good, but for me a little over seasoned and I think a little more acidity which cut through the fat level from the cod. My wife had the beef sirloin with truffle mash which was excellent. The beef was melt in the mouth and truffle mash tasted great. I had the french toast which had beautiful taste and texture. For me I would prefer something else such as strawberries to accompany the dish rather than coffee ice cream but that’s just my preference. The coffee ice cream had good taste. My wife had a very good chocolate fondant. The service was good. In general a very good meal for the price charged and up to 1 Michelin star standard."
"I had the opportunity to enjoy a family lunch at this restaurant. It gives the impression of being a traditional rural cider restaurant with a critical twist to modernity. We all had the tasting menu (go for it) which included a vast array of traditional dishes for what the ingredients where with a modern focus on texture, presentation and exposure of the dish. Location may be out of hand, but then again that's the charm of the place, it's 10 minutes away from the city centre. If you want to taste the flavours of the Basque Country and you're demanding about basic culinary principles, jump into a taxi and head up there, on egin!"

"What can I say..horrible experience. We got the tasting menus and in the bake we found a bug, yes you read that correctly, on the cracker on top of the fish. What made matters worse is that they did absolutely NOTHING. They just replaced our dish and we did NOT even get an apology. We couldn’t take a pic of the bug as they recognized our shock immediately and took away the plate. But the most surprising thing is that they didn’t even apologize. They just gave us a complimentary wine at the end of the meal with a box of chocolates with a fly inside. How is this a Michelin star restaurant is beyond me! I understand that this was a mistake but at least say sorry from the chef, the manager or anybody lol."
"We had a stunning meal here for my husbands 60th Birthday. Usually as my son has a nut and shellfish allergy and my daughter is gluten intolerant it causes some problems and can at times spoil our meal if not dealt with in a professional manner. Here there was no issue whatsoever and we were free to just enjoy our lovely meal. 5 of us had the tasting menu and my son ordered a la carte. All food was delicious and cooked to perfection. I cannot think of a bad word to say about this restaurant. Warm and welcoming, especially as we had just got caught in a heavy downpour. Many thanks for making this such an enjoyable birthday celebration."
A perfect evening! The restaurant is a bit out of town and has quite unusual decor (ie bikes on the wall and huge barrels jutting into the restaurant)but which works very well. The tables are far apart so you get plenty of space which is great.The staff were all very good and helpful. We chose to go a la carte and what was particularly welcome for my wife ( who does not have a big appetite)was the fact that almost all the available dishes were available in half portions. Our amuse bouche sardine mouse was amazing as were our starters- tuna tartar and anchovy lasagne. For mains we enjoyed hake and a delicious lamb shank. My wife loved her dessert- lime macaroon with passion fruit sorbet -and my cheese selection was beautifully presented and tasted very good .We were recommended a very good (but inexpensive red wine) and when the time came to pay the bill ( and we were not in any way rushed) the value for money was quite outstanding.
"We celebrated a joint 50th birthday at Eme Be, while visiting for the weekend. We had a party of 30 and a number of ""foodies"", including one person who has authored two cook books and runs various nutrition programs. Everyone was delighted by a wonderful tasting menu, well selected wines to accompany the variety of local foods and efficient service. We had a large space all to ourselves, allowing us to move around and chat between dishes. I can highly recommend this restaurant ... get in while you still can !!! Parking also available (best to get a taxi home)."
"Difficult to find reservations at night however It’s very possible to get one for lunch if your schedule is flexible and if it’s not makes flexible as this is one not to be missed. Great decor , impecable service, a fine place with simple elegance . To call this “Food” is a misnomer. It’s a culinary work of art"
