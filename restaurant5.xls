Trikuharri Taberna Jatetxea
"That was the best place in Donosti. Very friendly staff, all the time ready to answer our questions even if the restaurant was crowded all the time. The food was so good that we forgot to make picture of it. Very reasonable prices. The second night of our stay we went to some pricy restaurant in the old town and we were very disappointed. Big plus: except for us, there were no tourists, just locals."
"I recommend this place. We arrived in San Sebasti?n with big expectations about food, and this taberna didn’t disappoint us. Excellent food, very nice service, pleasant wines, really nothing to complain, and not expensive! My husband is allergic to gluten and the young woman serving us was very helpful and he had many choices, all very good.specially the squids were excellent, perfectly cooked."
"I’ll just say that we had to come back every night of our stay in San Sebastian. I agree with the very positive reviews. Service is kind and professional. Amane was amazing ! Food is just perfect. The salmorejo, solomillo and txistorra are truly remarkable. Not to miss in case you are near Ondarreta beach and, if somewhere else in San Sebasti?n, go at least once. You won’t be disappointed!"
"We ate here after grabbing some stools across from the bar as a family of 5 as a walk in on a Sunday lunchtime but after trying the food I would recommend booking a table! The servings of both food and drink were noticeably bigger than in the Old Town and provided great value for money. The patatas bravas, calamares and fried chicken were all delicious and the portions were generous.Service was also quick considering the place was heaving with customers inside and outside. Great local Basque atmosphere."
We found this place whilst already meeting some friends in the neighborhood. We were pleasantly surprised. The waitress was lovely and spoke very good English. The pork secret was well grilled and I loved my fish dish. It’s very well priced for the quality of food.
This is very much a business with two separate halves. The bar is full of local drinkers eating Pinxtos and creating a great atmosphere. Then in the back are the diners enjoying the predominantly fish courses. They do some things really very well indeed. Other Diallo she’s are very good but not outstanding. The warm seafood salad with shrimps and elvers is fantastic. The cod main course was very good and the pork “secret” (tenderloin strips) was very good. It’s not a 5/5 establishment but it’s a solid 4/5.
"We have been in San Sebasti?n for about a week now and this is hands down, by far the best meal we've had. We had the menu del dia and, because there were three of us, ordered one of each item for the first and second courses. The grilled octopus and shrimp salad was the highlight- both cooked perfectly with delicious sauce. The grilled tuna and pork loins were mouth watering. The desserts were light and not too sweet.I wish I would have gotten the name of our server - she was helpful and attentive and never rushed the meal, despite the restaurant being busy.We'll be back tomorrow for the pintxos. And possibly the next day too..."
"The place was totally full and quite loud when I went for to get some food around 3 pm. I was in San Sebastian for work and wanted to est something local , preferably seafood for reasonable price. As a single foreign woman its easy to feel strange in Spanish bars/ restaurants alone and I had this feeling here too. The service was quick but not the genuine nicest what I have ever experienced during my several stays in Spain - but still okay, likely the peak hour what made the personnel a bit overwhelmed."

"I has been in this restaurant months ago and I always eat very well, their cuisine can stay in from at the best restaurants of the zone. The beer is excellent the location is unformal. The price is cheeper. Very good really suggested."
"Come here, eat lots of excellent food and be very happy. Everything is delicious and cooked to perfection and the staff are lovely. The beer is good too. Remember to book though, otherwise you will be outside looking at all the happy people inside and feeling bereft."

"Yes they’re really busy, yes they’re a bit rude, yes they’d rather speak English over Spanish and are proudly Basque over anything else but that’s the charm of this place. Most people are standing but there are a few seats indoors. I think they’d rather not have families as it’s a fast paced place that said they didn’t turn us away! There’s a huge selection of freshly cooked food meats, seafood, veggies and it’s a great price. We went twice and it got better when we knew what we were in for. If we went back to San Seb I’d be back here before I’d hit anywhere in the old town!"

"Unpretentious menu and decor, reasonably priced and remarkably good. We ordered a wide range of dishes on two visits and there wasn't a false note. Great for families as well - our kids devoured the chicken and calamari. Friendly staff"
"We visited here twice in a week, as we were staying in an Airbnb apartment just around the corner. We tried the beef cheeks as a pintxos on our first visit, but my husband couldn't get enough of it, so on our return trip, ordered it as a main course. This bar is a gem of a find, fantastic food, served in super fast time by friendly, energetic & efficient young staff. We arrived with three young children & poor Spanish, yet they quickly accommodated for both - giving us a table at the back of the bar & handing over an English menu. And even though we got the kids to try the octopus and prawn skewers, the foie gras and lamb pintxos - which they all declared was ""tasty and delicious"", both boys reverted back to type & ordered burgers! Despite this, our fabulous waitress pre-emptied our son's cultural palates, and served said burgers with tomato sauce! Thereafter she could do no wrong in their eyes, and they both agreed that the burgers topped any they had before - so high praise indeed from the most fussiest of eaters! I loved the food, but also loved the ambience of the place, it was a busy, lively bar which caters for all, young, old, local or visitor alike. There were couples having a quiet meal, groups of lads traipsing in with their food shopping, and friends having a girlie meal and catch-up, and families gathering outside on the street. It is very popular as a bar and restaurant, a lot of tables were reserved - so get there early or pre-book. The price for the food is incredibly reasonable and I suspect, why it's so popular. Cannot recommend Trikuharri enough. We will be back!"
"We knew it would be unpretentious when the glass of wine arrived in a tumbler. We knew the service would be good when the waitress gave us two a table for four, anticipating that we might like to sit side by side looking out at the buzz. We were hoping to beat the San Sebasti?n high art /higher prices tendency yet sample great fish and beef. So we did. The English version of the menu helped. Glad we were not put off by the crowd of a male sports club outside who had reserved the whole place for later. Just 25 seats plus perching area with stools but that meant personal service and a great buzz. The baked hake was juicy generous and perfect as was the duck confit and tapas starters of darkly beefy beef cheeks. Highly recommended."
