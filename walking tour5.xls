Evening Pintxo-Tapas Tour with Discover San Sebastian
"We had a fantastic evening tour with Eskey as our guide. Her enthusiasm and love for her city was infectious as she lead our small group of 7 to the best pintxos bars in the old town in San Sebasti?n. She provided a nice balance of history and fun in the most relaxing and engaging of ways introducing us to bars, particular drinks to match the food and to the most amazing fresh pintxos to die for. Thank you Eskey for the memorable experience and a particular thanks to the other 5 members of our group who were so kind, friendly and generous with their company - much appreciated. A memorable night"
"Escarne is an incredible tour guide. We were very lucky to be taken on a tour with her. She gave us a great exposure to the history of San Sebasti?n, and was able to sneak us to the front of the best pinxto restaurants in old town. This is the best tour experience in the city."
"We had already visited San Sabastian twice before and brought our friends here to share the experience. This time we decided on Esky’s Pinxtos and wine evening tour because we remembered how crazy busy the bars can get on a Saturday night. This tour put the food and wine centre stage, with Esky’s energy and enthusiasm driving us from bar to bar. She organised some freshly made delicacies, in places we may not necessarily have appreciated. Loved the sidre pouring and the bar specialising in anchovies. Also loved the way she found corners for us inside or encouraged locals to allow us some table sharing space outside. She knows food and the local scene, we really trusted her as a guide. The Basque cheesecake at the end is still one of my highlights."
"To book such a tour may seem like an extravagance. But having done it, we’d say it’s a must. Eskerne has a wonderful way about her and magics up fantastic food and even tables and chairs to enjoy it at in the most unexpected places. What a spectacular range of food and drink tastes we got to enjoy. All the food was fresh out of the kitchens. With Eskerne setting the standard we were all quickly at ease and like old friends on a special night out. We loved it so much we’d do it again and know it would be different but as good next time."
Great experience Esky is a very professional guide who knows all the best places very personable and fun. She accommodated everyone on the tour and made adjustments along the way to please everyone.
My husband and I had a wonderful tour! Eskera was so much fun and made our tour a delight. We ate many Pintxo and drank plenty of wine/beer! Eskera was knowledgeable about the city and answered many questions while still making it fun!
"Esky is an electric tour guide. She’s excited to share her home with her guests & works to cater to the group every step of the way. She knows the food, the history, & just about everyone in the neighborhood. Her attention to detail is unlike any guide I’ve ever met - she takes photos along the way she’ll WhatsApp to you after the tour & she sends the names of which restaurants you visit & what she’d recommend for each spot. I mentioned I was having trouble booking a surf lesson, she called a friend with a surf shop & I had a spot the next day with him that was a great one on one lesson.I ended up booking a private day with her at the end of our pintxo tour too. You’re going to want to meet Esky when you’re in SS."
"If you want an historical tour while you are enjoying great food, wine and camaraderie then you have to choose Eskerne's tour. Eskerne is the guest that you want to have at your dinner. You will leave her company sated and yet yearning for one last laugh with Eskerne. She is without peer. Do yourself a favor and spend three hours with someone who will leave you with a lasting smile."
"A must while visiting San Sebasti?n. Eskerne will having you laughing as you stroll through the Old Town learning some local history and enjoying a fabulous gastronomic pintxos experience!! A true local experience with someone who greatly enjoys sharing her passion for her home, history and food!!!"
