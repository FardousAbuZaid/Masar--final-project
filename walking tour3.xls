Iglesia de San Vicente
One of three major churches in the San Sebastian- Donastia area. Children baptized here run in families as do those from Santa Maria del Coro.
"The oldest Gothic style church, San Vicente was built starting in the early 16th century and added to over the following years with the alter piece depicting both St Vicente and St Sebastian."
Really liked this church outside and inside. Inside the stain glass windows were amazing and there was lots of different parts to see.
San Vicente was my favorite of the three churches we visited while walking the town. Though the inside was interesting (nothing awe inspiring) the sculptures outside in the courtyard were different. The side chapels were also interesting and warrented a quick drop in and look around.
"The castle-like Iglesia de San Vicente stands in the northeast section of San Sebastian's Old Town. We came across the massive 16th-century sandstone structure while exploring the city and stopped to admire its Basque Gothic architecture. But later additions display other styles. For example, a Baroque portico before the outer door originated in the 17th century. A quite modern Pieta sculpture by Basque sculptor Jorge Oteiza in collaboration with Jose Ramon Anda has been on the wall by the southern door since 1999. We entered the church (no admission charge) and were surprised to find that no other visitors had yet arrived on a weekday morning. The peaceful atmosphere contributed to our enjoyment of the well-maintained interior. It includes stunning side chapels, soaring ceilings and round stained-glass windows. I especially liked looking at a model of the church that was on display. But nothing topped the magnificent gold altarpiece by Ambroseo de Bengoechea and master sculptor Joanes de Iriarte. It features many niches containing small statues of saints. I sat in a pew for about 10 minutes, looking at this incredible masterpiece."
"Located in the Parte Vieja, the Church of St Vincent was built from the 15th -16th centuries. It is reportedly the oldest church in San Sebastian. The church has an attractive interior with nice stained glass round windows and Gothic details. Definitely worth stopping inside for a while."
"Its Gothic style Church has soaring ceilings and round stained glass windows, easy to find this holy church and strategic to get pintxos. One of most famous icon in San Sebastian which you have to come when you visit this town."
"If the doors are open > I’m in! Gotta give thanks, praise & reverence unto JAH for showing me yet another great city. Also, one gets to make 3 wishes in every new Church one visits! Ain’t no guarantee they will come true but it doesn’t hurt to try."
"After having seen Chillida's Peine del Viento at the end of Ondarreta beach, we were overjoyed to discover he had more sculptures on display in the grounds of the oldest church in San Sebastian in the Old Town. Gigantic hands in tender but powerful gestures were just amazing and so striking. The Gothic church of San Vicente was equally interesting. Upon entering through the more Baroque entrance we found ourselves in a low vestibule above which was space for the choir and the organ. The Gothic ribbings served both to show the architectural structure as well as its decorative elements. The low vestibule space suddenly contrasts with the very high ribbed ceiling of the nave leading the eyes to the 5-levelled golden 16th century altar. An equally powerful Pieta may be seen on the right side of the nave. The experience of the Chillida sculptures and the Gothic church was certainly very aesthetically satisfying."
