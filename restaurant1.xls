"It was just amazing dishes one after another. Very creative mix of food, surprising texture, and complex taste made us feel like going heaven. Every dish was complete set of food, and we felt as if we were appreciating art. We had never expected to have sea urchin to be served outside of Japan (we are sea urchin lovers especially in SUSHI style) and it was nice challenge to cook for western way. Wines we ordered were mostly local ones which went very well with dishes. This is a worth to visit place when you are in San Sebastian."
Of the three restaurants we dined at during our San Sebastian vacation (Akelarre and Arzak being the other two) this was by far the best. The tasting menu was fantastic from start to finish except for the pigeon dish (could be because we are not fond of pigeons) so would recommend seeing if they could substitute a different dish. The setting is great (same architect as Akelarre) and the service is impeccable and what you would expect from a three star Michelin restaurant. The sommelier did a perfect job of matching our wine to our dinner (did not do the wine matching menu and just ordered our own bottles). Told him our price range and he did a fantastic job finding us outstanding bottles. Highly recommended!
"An incredible experience! We have been to many Michelin restaurants around the world and this was our favourite! They were able to cater for my allergies and other (rather fussy!) dietary preferences, which was so greatly appreciated. The food (especially the sirloin) was incredible and the wait staff were very attentive (without being overbearing)."
"If you are in the area of San Sebastian and like gastronomy, this restaurant is an absolute must. The food is exquisite, at the level of the best of the best 3 star restaurants. Moreover, the staff is extremely nice and very, very flexible regarding dietary requirements. They accepted to tailor the menu to specific needs in a very nice way. All dishes were absolutely incredible, beautiful, and new. The service was perfect, everyone being nice and helpful and making this experience absolutely incredible."
"Nice meal, nice service. Will come again and again with my family. The atmosphere was very nice and cozzy."
"Once again, amazed by the incredible experience in Martin Berasategui. A menu where every single bite is a piece of art, delicate and harmoniously crafted. An impressive cellar and great wine service, adequate and gorgeous decanters. Perfect service, impecable pace, all done with sympathy and grace. And the personality of Martin, very often present, making feeling you at home while you are in one of the top restaurants in the world. All of this in a scenario of wonder surrounded by nature. Wow"
Lived up to both our expectations!! I went with the 25th anniversary tasting menu which included 10 out of 12 seafood tastes plus 3 desserts. Hubby doesn’t do seafood so excellent serving staff helped him craft a menu of small bites plus 2 half entrees which kept him on pace with me. Wine pairings - spot on! I wanted to expand my seafood experience and smoked eel as one plate and a second one with uni fit the bill and both were winners!
"The staff goes beyond friendly, in ? way that makes you feel truly welcome. Not in a fake way, like in so many orher fine dining restaurants. Best staff ever, The food is amazing, and a few of the coarses stand out, like their signature dish with smoked eal and fois gras.Wines are perfectly matched and also at surpisingly good prices.One of the best restaurants in the world!"
"We went here for lunch with the family. I did a bit of research and selected this place which I thought would fit the taste of my 4 teenage (14-24) children. We were not disappointed! We truly enjoyed the dinner, the ambiance and the outstanding service. The waiting staff was really friendly and found the exact right tone. My kids really enjoyed the experience. This was their first 3 star meal and they enjoyed it thoroughly. Highly recommended!"
"San Sebasti?n has an incredible array of fine dining restaurants, my wife and I have had the pleasure earring at Akelarre, Mugaritz, Arzak and Mirador de Ulia. This restaurant is definitely up there, we arrived via taxi and were impressed with the greeting and prompt offer of a drink. As we were sipping our cava the bread and butter arrived, WOW worth the trip just for this course. The food was incredible, building flavours and textures throughout the meal. Highlights were the oyster, hake, lobster salad, pigeon and chocolate lime. The sommelier was very food and helped choose some excellent wines to accompany the dinner. We even got to meet Martin at the end and he seemed so humble that people travel to eat his food. If you're in San Sebasti?n and want an incredible experience, book here."
"This lunch was a special treat. The food is beyond compare, interesting, tasty , healthy with fresh food and light dishes. I had the tasting menu. My wife had the signature salad with lobster and the lamb chops. The service is impeccable. Kind, knowledgeable , appropriately attentive. Huge wine list. Sommelier was perfect with his selections when we described what we liked in a white and then red. The facility is also special. In a modernized large home and gardens just outside San Sebasti?n All three stars totally appropriate. it is higher priced so be ready to forget the expense and truly enjoy. It is worth every penny. Plan 3 hours at least We want to return with family"
i go there with my wife it's like haven and super familiar restaurant .there food is very testy and fresh look .i never forget to go again with my family .thank lot of.
"We booked lunch for our daughter's birthday and it made for a special day for her. The food was excellent and very interesting. The staff and service was second to none. We found one of local waiter particularly amusing in the way he explained the dishes to guests at the other tables. You could tell he loved his job. Our family is from Melbourne and have eaten at the best 2 restaurants in Melbourne which were ranked 20th and 58th best in the world in 2018 but we think Martin's restaurant and food is better. This was even before the surprise when we finished out lunch and was leaving. As they knew it was our daughter's birthday they had a surprise present for her - a chef's coat personally signed by Martin!! Our daughter was so happy with the present she did what all young people do 1st chance she had - take a photo of it. Superb experience. Must come back again somehow, some time."
"Had a great dinner with my family at Martin Berasategui. My wife and I ordered exquisite food, and my two young boys joined us with more basic food. We had a wonderful time in a setting that was not very friendly towards children. Staff was very formal and attentive, but not as warm as in order high level restaurants. When the bill came, I was surprised that they had charged us the full dinner price for our children given what they had ordered. Particularly as this did not happen to us either at Arzak or Akelarre."
Our family of 3 had a lunch back in July here. It is our first experience in a Michelin 3 star restaurant. We were in a rush as we had to catch the bull fighting at Pamplona on the same day. We chose the tasting menu and finished it in a little more than 2 hours. I would say the dishes are definitely out of this world although I am not sure if everybody would like this out of the world style.
I went with my family and we all ordered the tasting menu. However my sister is not a fan of liver the waiter was extremely observant and picked up on this and offered to have all the things on the menu that contained liver changed. The presentation of the food is exquisite! It also tasted divine! The staff were very helpful and friendly. You must go there if ever in the area
"Had dinner last night - what an amazing experience. Went with the Tasting Menu - a couple of the dishes had to be altered to accommodate Gluten Free, the Bread (3 types) was Incredible! I want the receipe! Unforgettable Meal - my favourite was the Wild Rabbi"
"Please do not let my title confuse you....my comment is redundant because I can only repeat what has been said below by many other contributors. I will just add three more things to give you an idea of the impecable service at this restaurant...1) My wife is gluten intolerant and she was not only baked an exquisite bread just for her but her tasting menu dishes were prepared without gluten and were equally fantastic. 2) My wife does not drink alcohol but her beverage of choice, COKE ZERO (I know, yikes!) came in a glass with absolutely perfectly formed ice cubes that were contoured to the shape of the glass. 3) As we started eating, the waiter came over to apoligize because he had noted that three of the guests were left handed, and they had not placed the silverware setting accordingly...the attention to detail is, well, extreme. Bravo Martin!"
