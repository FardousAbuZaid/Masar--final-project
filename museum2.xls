Eureka! Zientzia Museoa
"This is a really great science museum, full of interactive exhibits such as an exhibition of plasticised body parts and even a live animal display (which was only available for an hour, so the animals presumably had more space to roam around during the rest of the day)! It managed to make topics that usually bore our children, such as electricity or levers, very engaging and fun. It's easily reached from the centre of town by bus, and you could easily stay for 3-4 hours. There's a restaurant next door that does really good Spanish food including tapas, without being over-priced as some museum restaurants can be. All the descriptions are in English and French as well as Spanish and Basque. We went there expecting it to be a small-town museum but it compares very well to science museums in other European capital cities!"
I would have rated this place with five stars but on arrival some of the attractions are closed and only open at certain times. This is not made clear on the web site. So if you want to do the planetarium or the virtual reality areas it's worth a phone call to make sure they are open. That apart the museum is a great experience.
"not too crowded. Very engaging, great mini aquarium, saw the feeding of little lizards, very helpful staff, outside area, lots to try and experiment with, great for kids."
Well worth the money. Great interactive exhibits for the children in all of us. Kids and parents had a great time. In multiple languages including English.
"Displays in various languages, a good place to while away a few hours especially kids up to 12-14 and if raining. Not easy to find by car, as its in a business park on the edge of town. Wasn't overly expensive and the cafe was very good with a great priced menu del dia."
"We took our kids here on a cold, though sunny, winters day. The museum is well laid out with all the explanations in Basque, Spanish, French, and English. There are so many things to do for the kids and at least 90% of the exhibits are basic experiments for the kids (and kids at heart) to try. The staff is so nice and helpful. They have great simulators. Finally, the museum restaurant is good for a coffee or a lunch. If you've got half a day to spend it is well worth it. You can take the bus from the center of town to this great museum."
"so many thing to see and to do, it's very interesting for the whole family. We spent there half day, and it was n't enough! You'll enjoy. Also available a restaurant so you can make a brake and to take some energy before you continue with other activities and experiments!"
"We had a blast at this museum during a windy and very rainy day in June. It's easy to take a public bus out to the museum, and they have a fabulous restaurant on site -- a perfect option for lunch! The museum has lots of different rooms with hands-on exhibits, plus you can pay extra for special fun stuff that happens at specific hours of the day. Our kids found it handy that most explanations were offered in English. Recommended!"
