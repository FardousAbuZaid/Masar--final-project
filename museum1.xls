San Telmo Museoa
"I wanted to visit the museum to learn more about Basque life but I had the happy surprises of a temporary exhibition on Magellan and the discovery of a stunning convent cluster and church. You must go. The Magellan exhibition is very well done with the 5 ships and their itineraries meandering on the exhibition with massive screens showing the crew, the water etc. I was very impressed altogether. And at 6€ for a ticket, there's nothing not to like. To follow the visit, you can download an app on your mobile as not all displays are labelled in English (the Magellan exhibition is). There is a cafe next to the museum, which is at the bottom of Mount Urquell reachable via the stairs. Big bags can be left in lockable lockers at the entrance."
"If you want to learn something about Basque culture and history, you cannot miss this place. On Tuesday it is free, but price is anyhow very accessible. Allow yourself a half day visit, you will not regret it."
"Located in the corner of Old Town, in a former monastery, the museum focuses on Basque history. During our visit, there was an exhibit chronicling circumnavigation the world by Magellan (well, not exactly, as we learned! It was fascinating to learn that it was, in fact, a Basque sailor, Elcano who really should have gotten much more credit than he got! The other exhibits pertaining to local history and showcasing the history of the original monastery, are not very well captioned in English but still provided a lot of interesting artificats. I wouldn't really say this is a ""must-visit"" if your time is limited but if you have some time, it is worth a peek. We spent about 3 days in the area and it really did enhance our appreciation and understanding of the region and made our other explorations richer so we were very glad to have visited early on in our stay."
"This museum, set in a beautiful former monastery, provided a thorough and well-presented exposition of Basque culture and history. Highly recommended!"
"This a great place to visit during a rainy day in San Sebastian. Tuesdays are free which is nice. You can get a free audio guide with entry. Only the main museum has infrequent numbers where you can use the audio guide. The rotating exhibits don't have any audio guides. Most signs are in Basque (Euskara) or Spanish, very few are in English. The art exhibits as well as the modern history of the Basque region and culture is very interesting."
visited this museum in the heart of the old town on a tuesday and was pleasantly surprised to find it was free. Good and varied collection of artefacts/exhibits means its a good way to learn about the history of the area. Worth visiting
"We had a lovely time walking around the museum and really enjoyed the Temporary Exhibition of Sandro Miller, Malkovich, Homage to Photographic Masters which is on in November. Every Tuesday the museum has free entry."
This museum is well worth a visit. The huge Sert canvases in the church are very impressive. The galleries are very well laid out and the history of the area is very well done. This museum is a must visit
"If you’re in San Sebasti?n for more than one day, San Telmo Museum is a must. At only €6, you can explore the beautiful church and a ton of great exhibits with many audio and video experiences to complement the fantastic collection of historical items. A fair amount of items include English translations, but for descriptions and details that are only in Spanish and Basque you can easily use the free Google Translate app’s camera feature to get an instant translation."
