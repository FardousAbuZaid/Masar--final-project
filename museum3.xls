Euskal Itsas Museoa
"Well worth a visit. This small museum had just opened after renovations when we stopped in. The ground floor provides some interesting insight to the cod and whaling history of the area, and the second floor had a fascinating historical account of the early clothing industry back in the Middle Ages- not something I would have normally been curious about, but it turned out to be a good learning experience."
Did you know how the Basque people contributed towards American Independence? If you come here you will find out. As well seeing the importance of the Basque people in the Canadian whaling industry. A fascinating insight that every maritime lover should look at.
Apparently there is no permanent exhibit space and one takes a chance on whatever the temporary exhibit happens to be. Currently it is about toys associated with the sea and I was really not interested in looking at dolls and toy boats. Fortunately the admission charge is not high and it is free on Thursdays.
"This museum is small and houses one rotating exhibit; when I went, the exhibit was about nautical-themed toys throughout history in San Sebasti?n and Spain in general. I thought it was fascinating and unique. This museum would be a great place to take kids because of the subject matter and there was also a large play area set up. Exhibit text only in Spanish and Basque but it's not really necessary to be able to read it. I would suggest popping in when you are in the harbor area."
an interesting little musem of maritime history and tools and a great aquarium. no parking but easy to get to walkink or taxi. Scary sharks alive and dead. Next door is the old maritime which is now a free exhibition space.
The museum is closed on Mondays. Opening hours a bit erratic but eventually we managed to see the exhibition. Its is on until the end of the year. Entitled Women and the Sea it is an in depth look at the role women have played in San Sebastian maritime history. Take your time to enjoy the comprehensive exhibition.
"We discovered this museum while exploring the harbourside of San Sebastian where the Aquarium is. The sign on the facade of the museum showing a woman standing on the edge of a cliff staring at the ocean attracted our attention, so we went inside. The English title of the exhibition is *Women and the Sea* and goes from Jan. 29 to Nov. 19, 2016. As the exhibition is not translated in English, we were given a set of xeroxed materials with English translation of the text of the exhibition materials such as old photographs, art works depicting women and their relationship with the sea. The exhibition highlighted women, who sailed the seas either as companions, wearing men's garments to hide their gender, also as pirates, and their involvement in maritime activities. It was interesting to learn about women's work in the fishing and port activities in the 18th and 19th century. A great deal of emphasis was placed on the work of the boat women, who pulled the towropes of barges up the river banks, and those who transported the cod from the boats to the warehouses. Women have come a long way since then, and it is hard to imagine that this women had to perform hard physical work,dividing their time between looking after their homes, their families apart from engaging in other work such as shell fishing, repairing fishing gear, unloading, auctioning and selling the fish and manual work in the canneries. Going through this exhibition was indeed a very informative and humbling experience. The entrance fee is minimal, so if you have time to spare, you may also find this exhibition interesting."
"Perhaps things get lost in translation but this should be more appropriately named ""Fisheries Museum"" as just about all of the otherwise modest number of exhibits relate to fisheries rather than naval matters. If that's what interst you by all means go and visit, otherwise dont bother."
