Buen Pastor Cathedral
Quiet space for start of the day. Stark interior after grandeur and gold of churches to the south. Some interesting statues and a humorous addition to the model of the Cathedral in a side chapel!
"It is a beautiful church and if you are lucky to visit it a certain time of day when the sun is shining through the stained glass windows on to the the interior of the cathedral it is a magical, almost mystical experience."
Do not be deceived by how the Cathedral looks on the outside the inside is beautiful with lots that catch the eye especially the Altar area and the stained glass windows.
As we were wandering around the town we saw this beautiful church. Unfortunately the front was covered in scaffolding but was very impressive non the less.
"I attended mass several times at this majestic cathedral and loved feeling a part of the locals. The cathedral’s history is impeccable, and stained glass windows and beautiful side altars well worth he visit."
"Peaceful and calm, away from all the noise and bustle of San Sebastian. Worth the detour inside the cathedral to admire the stained glass windows, art & sculptures & absorb the calm atmosphere."
Some reviews label it “austere” but it’s a lovely spacious cathedral with some beautiful art and many colorful stained glass windows. The altar isn’t as ornate as many others but it’s very nice. Well worth a visit! The exterior was clothed in netting for some kind of maintenance so the tower is currently obscured.
The cathedral was being repaired when I visited so most of the exterior was covered and not visible. The cathedral was open and the inside is nice and worth a stop. The location is also good and you get a sense of the community and vibe of the area.
I enjoyed this Cathedral for its chapels. The woodwork is extraordinary. There are several stain glass windows as well. The exterior is under renovation so I was not able to see its grandeur. We viewed this with our private city tour guide. She provided us with history and context as to hwy this cathedral was built and significant events since is was completed
"During our visit the tower was covered by nets and beiing under reconstruction, but despite this we could see the building is impressive and dominating the area."
