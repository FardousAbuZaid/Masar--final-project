"I have been to the Lance & Malone store several times because I am captivated by the originality of the collages they make. I have traveled to various places and have never seen such innovative creations, they have captivated me. In fact, I commissioned a collage that mixes images of Donostia with Copacabana and the result has been wonderful. I'm lovin 'it.
