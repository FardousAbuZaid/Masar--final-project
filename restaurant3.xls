Misura
"This review is a little late, we visited in September 2019 but only just getting round to writing this. The restaurant is a little out of the way but worth taking the time to find. We went for Saturday lunch, there were probably 5-6 other tables occupied. We sat on one of the high tables looking into the kitchen and tried one of the tasting menus with matching wines. The quality of the food and cooking was outstanding. Each course was well presented and there was enough of it. Wines were different and not was I would have chosen but different in a positive way and showed off different Spanish wine makers. Service was great and I think overall good value for money. I would highly recommend based on this visit."
The restaurant was recently reopened after the Covidcrise. The menu was fine. The marinated sardines and the bonitofish tasted well. Outside diner was possible.
"This place is part of the hotel Arima and located in the cellar / ground floor of the hotel. I was a bit disappointed because we visited Misura on a Friday evening, prime time and there was only one other table occupied. The tables give you a grand view on the glass paneled kitchen. Impressive you see all the works. We started with tuna which was good, but lacked the smoothness as you might expect. I took the pork roast which a bit too difficult to cut. Coffee, espresso was fine. Not a cheap option, you dine in an fine ambience but the empty chairs around you makes you wonder."
"Vegetables at last!! in a lovely quiet and peaceful atmosphere. Cooked to perfection and and creatively put together for the eye. We loved the variation, gentleness of the staff, the excellent wine. Starters are usully a choice of vegetable dishes, mains include fish and meat, mouthwatering deserts to finish.The price was very reasonable too. Thank you!"
"Interesting menu with wonderful veggie options, superb wine list and great staff. Spanish cooking with a twist"
"Warm and cozy ambience with a first quality menu and highly professional staff. Service is sober and just perfect. Gazpacho beetroot was such a tasty starter, followed by a delicious grilled octopus. The maitre was always ready to explain in details all dished and he is a best in class sommelier! Loved the amazing chocolate dessert too! Very reasonable price for such premium quality organic and healthy ingredients super well cooked. A must try even if not in the city centre."
"At first glance, this restaurant may seem out of your way. But a quick bus ride from San Sebastian gets you inside the cozy restaurant of Misura. Such a romantic, inviting environment with friendly and knowledgeable staff (whom on that particular night spoke English, French and Spanish). We had the vegan tasting menu, though their a la carte and regular tasting menu looked incredible, too. My rule of thumb is if a restaurant can do veggies well, you know the chef(s) is truly genius. And genius they were! The vegan tasting meal was an incredible experience, both gastronomically and aesthetically. There were multiple courses (I want to say around 10) including a vermouth cocktail, bottle of white wine, glass of red wine and dessert with a ginger shot. All of this for ~70 euros per person! What a great experience. Can't wait to go back when I visit San Sebastian again! (and try the scrumptious looking octopus)!"
"10 minutes from San Sebastian city, a mere taxi drive away, lays this raw diamond. I was truly amazed by the food and the service. They deserve 2 Michelin stars, but at the moment have prices of a brasserie. Don't miss this!"
"Some of the best food and one of the most pleasurable dining experiences ever.Beetroot Gazpacho, Red Kidney bean hummus, Green bean and chanterelle with Fondant potatoes, Citrus roast pumpkin, cauliflower couscous, Corillio Chicken, Sirloin with Quinoa and mushroom, Soufle. All certified organic and cooked to perfection in full view of the table. Vegies steamed and served ‘al dent?’ were the star ingredients. Guilt free orgasmic, organic dining."
"Of the four restaurants that we visited in the San Sebastian/Bilbao area this one surely comes out on top. The tasting menu is very well composed, perfectly executed as well as interesting and pleasantly surprising. Their efforts to go with organic foods paid off. The wine paring worked really well. The ambiance, where you see the actual efforts put in by the chefs combined with excellent and non intrusive service worked really well for us. If you are in the area and can make the small effort to go just outside of town - do it! Overall a really worth while experience."
"My sister hosted her destination wedding at Misura in the Arima hotel. Family and friends flew in from around the world. Dinner selection was an 8-course tasting menu. Every dish was presented beautifully, with tastes I may never encounter again. Starters: Beetroot and grape pazpacho (cold soup with drizzle of olive oil) Quinoa, apple, turmeric, spring onion salad Grilled zucchine tagliata, burrata, dried tomato, pesto, basil Cauliflower puree, 62^ egg, cod, smoked oil Mains: Grilled wild fish from market, sauteed mini vegetables, extra virgin olive oil Rabbit Royale, roasted tomato, shallot confit, swiss chard Dessert: Homemade tarte tatin of of the day (Pear) Staff were extremely attentive and friendly. Most spoke English. The food was amazing!"
"We hosted our wedding reception dinner at Misura and enjoyed the chef's recommended tasting menu for our group. Everything was beautifully presented, and meticulously executed. The restaurant prides itself on using local and organic products native to the region, thereby ensuring only the freshest items of the season are used. The dishes are flavourful, thoughtful, and easily one of the best meals we've ever had. Make sure to try the 62-degree egg and cod and the tarte tatin. What a delight! Everyone was raving about the culinary experience they had that night- not to mention, the attentiveness of the staff, and warmth of the environment. Everything was perfect! We will definitely come back to Misura and Arima again for our vow renewals!!! :) Thank you again for everything!"
"While there are a few meat-fish-fowl ""main"" dishes on the menu, the core of the menu is the various vegetable dishes, each of which can be ordered vegan, with dairy, or with meat-fish-fowl according to what your preferences may be. We went for the tasting menu with wine pairing. My wife took the vegetarian options, while I asked for fish, which turned up in some of the dishes. Naturally each of the dishes was a feast for the eyes, but the combination of flavors was exquisite. Particular favorites were the beetroot-grape (and various mystery ingredients) soup, the roasted celeriac, and the cauliflower cream with low-temperature poached egg, but all were very good -- so much so that although I enjoyed the fish with my dishes, I could have even done without it!. The wine pairings were all interesting and not poured in ridiculously tiny amounts. The service is excellent, and finally, for food of this creativity and quality, the price is extremely fair. Highly recommended for people who want a break from the Basque classics. The dining room is a lovely open modern space, but the location is a bit odd and out of the way. A taxi or car is probably required to get there for people staying downtown."
"We had a great dinner at Misura. One of our favorites of all time. Beautiful setting - a little out of the way, but worth it. Servers did a great job to make it a very enjoyable experience. And the food, especially all the vegetable dishes were phenomenal. We sat at a tall table next to the kitchen area and could watch them prepare our dinner. Curry eggplant, bean hummus and leeks with buratta were all amazing dishes! If you want to try something really good, and a little different from the rest, go to Misura."
"Lunch at Misura with friends was great! We had a delicious and clean meal in an international and classy place. The menu,building,location and atmosphere are nicely aligned with the green philosophy. Great experience! Totally recommend it!"
"From observing the Hotel from the outside, I was instantly impressed with the architecture and how in was built honoring the natural landscape existing around it! and the food did not disappoint! a wonderful fusion of traditional Spanish flavours like the remolacha gazpacho (beetroot gazpacho) and pulpo a la brasa (grilled octopus), to embracing other flavours like ceviche in ""leche de tigre"" and tataki bonito (seared bonito), to name a few. all dishes ordered had its own unique flavour with exceptional presentation. the sourdough bread was also amazing! Hats off to the amazing chefs and staff of ""Misura"". It was cool to be able to watch you as worked your magic!"
"The service, food quality, presentation, and dish compositions are absolutely breath-taking. The restaurant management makes a point in using high-quality, fresh, organic and natural food selections for their creative dishes, and they have succeeded."
"Warm and cozy ambience with a first quality menu and highly professional staff. Service is sober and just perfect. Gazpacho beetroot was such a tasty starter, followed by a delicious grilled octopus. The maitre was always ready to explain in details all dished and he is a best in class sommelier!
