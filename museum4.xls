Cibrian Gallery
"Perfectly located contemporary gallery in front of La Concha Bay and next to the old town. Two floor space with a very well curated exhibition and great selection of artist, I was very impressed. Thank you specially to Martin for his great explanation and for his time!"
What a surprise! Certainly the most exciting contemporary art gallery in San Sebastian. I discovered the work of the french artist Felicie d'Estienne d'Orves and I was blown away. The team is really professional and took the time to describe each work of the show. Can´t wait for the next exhibition..
I visited this gallery in May 2019 and saw a really cool exhibition by a French artist called F?licie d'Estienne d'Orves. The staff were very polite and very knowledgeable about the art on display. I'd really recommend visiting this gallery if you like contemporary art.
"Cibrian Gallery is an Oasis of art in San Sebastian. It is fortunate for the city to have spaces like this in the heart of San Sebasti?n with a discourse, cultural content and a quality of exhibitions worthy of large and important cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, London or New York. I can only say congratulations and THANK YOU. Good luck Cibri?n Gallery and see you soon"
"I have visited the gallery, and I have had the pleasure of Gregorio explaining to me the history behind some of his works. I have really enjoyed understanding concepts that had escaped my observation. Bringing contemporary art closer to the public seems to me to be a major challenge and I think that Cibri?n is doing a very good job. They have linked several exhibitions with a very good level and it is well worth a visit. Highly recommended."
"Cibrian Gallery is a contemporary art exhibition space that focuses on disseminating and marketing the latest art trends, they have more than 4 exhibitions a year, and they present super innovative national and international content. It is very worth it!"
A contemporary art gallery that presents international artists. It is an opportunity to have this type of gallery in Donosti. I recommend it.
It is hard to believe that there are private initiatives like this. My most sincere congratulations. An exhibition space with a lot of identity and a project that I will be attentive to. The Gallery Staff impeccable in their explanation
