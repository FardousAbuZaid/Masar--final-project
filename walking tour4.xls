Small-Group Electric Bike Tour in San Sebasti?n
"Two of us took the tour starting at 10:00. The location is easy to find and our guide, Alba, was there waiting for us. The bikes are really good and if your aren’t looking to work too hard the battery will take the strain on the up hill. Don’t look at the basket when you turn, it’s locked forward and takes a bit of getting used too! The tour was really interesting with a great explanation of the towns history, details of big events and the local experience of what San Sebasti?n is really like. A great way to get your bearings and learn about the area."
Our guide was a fun local with good knowledge I enjoyed seeing the real town not just tourist areas. Playing handball was superfine. A worthwhile tour and great way to see a lot in a short time. Really great bike trails everywhere. The tunnel was also a highlight.
"I highly recommend taking this fun ebike tour to get an overall picture of San Sebasti?n. My guide Paolo was awesome - very knowledgeable and friendly. Since nobody else registered in the afternoon, I had a private tour! One of the highlights was trying the local game of hand ball! Thanks Paolo for a great time! :)"
Excellent electric bike tour which was led brilliantly by Inigo. The bikes were brilliant and we saw lots of San Sebasti?n which we would never see on foot. Inigo was such a great guide who is passionate about San Sebasti?n and the Basque region. Highly recommended
Enjoyable ebike tour in San Sebastian. Four of us on the tour. Nice ebikes and a good guide shared interesting information about the City and history. Nice to go up high for an amazing view thanks to the power.
"What an amazing tour! My wife and I spent a few hours on the e-bikes with Inigo. San Sebastian took our breath away, but Inigo's tour gave us a perspective we could not have gotten otherwise. He took such great care of us, and the whole tour felt very personal. In fact, we have said several times since the tour that we felt like we made a new friend. I hope everyone gets a chance to take this tour when the visit San Sebastian - it's so worth it! Thank you so much for a great time, Inigo! (Dustin and Regan)"
